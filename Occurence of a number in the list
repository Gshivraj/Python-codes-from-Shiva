#Lets say that we have to count the number of tyimes number 3 occurs in the list [1,5,8,9,3,3,2,8]

Regular programme

count = 0
for i in lsts:
    if i ==3
    count = count+1
print("the number of times the number 3 occured is " count)





# Same programme using function

def occurrence(lsts):
    count = 0
    for i in lsts:
    if i ==3:
        count = count+1
    return count

result = occurence([1,5,8,9,3,3,2,8]
print(result)
